## Collaboration Workflow

To ensure smooth collaboration between human developers and AI agents (Jules) on the same branch:

1.  **Pull Before Working**: Always pull the latest changes from the branch before starting any new task to avoid conflicts.
2.  **Commit After Completing**: Commit all changes immediately after completing a task or request.
3.  **Preservation & Documentation Management**:
    *   **File Preservation**: Do not delete files, directories, or test suites unless explicitly instructed. Unintentional deletions disrupt the development flow and project history.
    *   **Documentation Integrity**: Documentation serves as the shared context for the team. Never discard large sections; instead, refactor or update them to maintain clarity and relevance.
    *   **Review Process**: If a file or documentation block appears redundant or obsolete, flag it for review or propose a reorganization OR removal rather than performing deletions
